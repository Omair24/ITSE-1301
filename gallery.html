        In the spring of 1962, Secret Service agent Robert Bouck installed secret recording devices in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room of the White House at the request of President Kennedy. Though the president never explained why he wanted to record his conversations, both Bouck and Evelyn Lincoln, JFK’s personal secretary, believed that his reason for doing this was to have a personal record of his time in the White House after he had left

        Despite JFK's infidelity, he and Jackie remained married for 10 years, until he died. His most famous affair was alleged to have been with movie star Marilyn Monroe. He is also believed to have engaged in affairs with the actresses Gene Tierney and Anita Ekberg

        One of the most discussed issues with the 1960 debates was the notion that people who listened to the radio were more likely to vote for Nixon while people who watched the debates on television were more likely to vote for Kennedy. One of the explanations to this phenomena was presidential candidates physical appearances during the debates with Kennedy appearing better on television than Nixon.

        On March 1, 1945, Kennedy retired from the Navy Reserve on physical disability and was honorably discharged with the full rank of lieutenant. When later asked how he became a war hero, Kennedy joked: "It was easy. They cut my PT boat in half."

        Carved  into the shell was a message: “NAURO ISL… COMMANDER… NATIVE KNOWS  POS' IT… HE CAN PILOT… 11 ALIVE… NEED SMALL BOAT… KENNEDY.” 
        During  the war, Kennedy commanded a patrol torpedo boat in the South Pacific.  On August 2, 1943, his boat was rammed by a Japanese destroyer. The  future president swam more than three miles to the nearest island,  towing an injured crewmate by holding the strap of his life jacket in  his teeth.
        The  men stayed on the island for two days with only coconuts to provide  nourishment
        While  foraging for food and water on August 5, Kennedy and a crewmember saw  two Solomon Islanders in a canoe. 
        The two men, Eroni Kumana and Biuku  Gasa, who risked thier lives to carry JFK's message etched on that coconut shell, back to the Allied troops.

    <p>
    From a young age, John F. Kennedy battled a range of health problems, some of which appeared to be life-threatening—so much so that he received the sacramental last rites a total of four times: first in 1947, when he became sick while traveling in England and was diagnosed with Addison’s disease; a second time in 1951, when he was suffering from an extremely high fever while in Japan; the third time in 1954, when he slipped into a coma following back surgery; and a final time on     the day of his assassination, on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas.
