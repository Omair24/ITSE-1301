      <dt id="2">2.) The U.S invades Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in an attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime.</dt>
      <dd>On April 17, 1961, a brigade of about 1,500 Cuban exiles landed at Bahia de Cochinos (Bay of Pigs) on the southern coast of Cuba.</dd> 
      <dd>Their mission was to overthrow the government of Fidel Castro by inciting revolt among the Cuban people.</dd> 
      <dd>Funded and supplied by the United States, this invasion ended in absolute failure with some of the exiles killed and many captured by Castro's army.</dd> 
      <dd>Although President John F. Kennedy wanted American involvement in the operation to remain covert, signs of CIA sponsorship of the brigade were obvious. </dd>

      <dt id="3">3.) JFK fought for discrimination against colored people via the "Freedom Rides"</dt>
      <dd>Black and white youths supported by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) set out on the first of several “freedom rides”</dd> 
      <dd>to challenge the lack of enforcement of ICC rules against racial discrimination in interstate travel.</dd> 
      <dd>This mixed-race group of "Freedom Riders" travelled together on busses from Washington, D.C.,</dd> 
      <dd>passing through several southern states on the way to New Orleans, Louisiana.</dd> 
      <dd>The Freedom Riders faced attacks and violence at the hands of those who supported segregation,</dd> 
      <dd>including local police, leading to the injury and arrest of several Riders.</dd> 
      <dd>Their efforts were successful in exposing the unlawful nature of the enforcement of segregation in bus travel and</dd> 
      <dd>in inspiring similar efforts to rectify injustice across the United States. </dd>

      <dt id="5">5.) Unwavering and Calm</dt>
      <dd>President Kennedy was committed to an aggressive space program.</dd> 
      <dd>The Soviet Union had surpassed the United States in the space race by launching Sputnik,</dd> 
      <dd>an artificial satellite, in 1957.</dd> 
      <dd>Since space technology demonstrated potential weapons,</dd> 
      <dd>this competition became an important aspect of the Cold War.</dd> 
      <dd>Although Kennedy realized the importance of space exploration to the military,</dd> 
      <dd>he remained firmly committed to a civilian-controlled program of manned space flights.</dd> 
      <dd>With the encouragement of Vice President Lyndon Johnson,</dd> 
      <dd>Kennedy appealed to Congress to increase spending on the space program in the hopes of surpassing the Soviets.</dd>

      <dd>The President warned that the purpose of the Soviet missiles in Cuba could be “none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere” and </dd>

      <dt id="8">8.) White House drafted a letter to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev</dt>
      <dd>The letter explained that once the Soviets removed the missiles from Cuba,</dd> 
      <dd>the United States would end its quarantine and would promise not to invade Cuba.</dd> 
      <dd>In a secret conversation with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Robert Kennedy pledged that,</dd> 
      <dd>in an addition to the terms in the letter, the United States would also remove American ballistic nuclear missiles from Turkey.</dd> 
      <dd>On October 28, the Cuban Missile Crisis was resolved when the Soviets accepted the U.S. compromise.</dd> 
      <dd>On November 20, Kennedy ended the naval blockade of Cuba after the Soviet Union had dismantled and removed the weapons from Cuba.</dd> 
      <dd>In one of the most dramatic crises of the Cold War, Kennedy and Khrushchev avoided violent conflict.</dd>
